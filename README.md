#### why ?
I develop out of love ‚ù§Ô∏è to code and desire to constantly improve myself as a software developer and architect. I believe that open source projects are the future, allowing other people to contribute and improve technology by covering more edge cases on a wider spectrum of a problems.

In modern times where technology drives our lives and big IT giants spit lots of software out trying to gain monopoly in every area, open source developers are more than needed to redirect the traffic back to people and focus on world's needs rather than tracking and collecting information for money.

#### who am I ?
I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Autopilot](https://www.autopilothq.com), a graduate of Computer Science at the [Faculty of Electronics](http://weka.pwr.edu.pl/en/), [Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology](http://pwr.edu.pl/en/) where I did both my Bachelor and Masters degrees. Full stack software developer with lot of experience. Knowing the highest programming method and cutting edge technologies. I am constantly striving to learn new technologies and looking for ways to better myself in this rapidly changing industry. Beside working full time I am doing [open source projects](https://rafallorenz.com/open-source/) and develop my own applications. I am dedicated to my craft and I am proud of my code. I am trying to write beautiful, efficient code to a high standard, in a timely and scalable way that improves the code-base of products in meaningful ways. 

#### my work
I am interested in DDD, CQRS, ES, gRPC, developing tools to help software work better in production, solving most common problems without overthinking it. Simple is the best but performance matters. Software I develop is often a result of the need to build solutions for problems I encounter at work. I like to explore different ways of problem solving and trying different methods to address any issues.

If you follow the same principles you are more then welcome to have a look at my work. If anything (and I hope more than one), seems interesting or useful for you, don't hesitate to contribute!
